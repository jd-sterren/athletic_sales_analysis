# athletic_sales_analysis
Finished later than expected due to medical reasons.
The code within and naming conventions could be cleaned up a little more than
what is currently in there but everything should be as requested.
Added join='inner' to athletic_sales_df = pd.concat([as_2020_df, as_2021_df], axis="rows", join="inner")

Added .sort_values('Total_Products_Sold', ascending=False) to Total_Products_Sold to see the proper results.

Updated the code to reflect consistency by replacing [['total_sales']].sum() for an aggregate.

Added the .sort_values to the section as well.

Corrected the resampling issues

Added a summary below:
December 12 to December 25 2021 are the most sales week in 2021 for Womenâ€™s 
Athletic Footwear most likely due to the Christmas holiday.  The top week sale 
right into Christmas was 3,098,970 with December 16, 2021 being the second to
